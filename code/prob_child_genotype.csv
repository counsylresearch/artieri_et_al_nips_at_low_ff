# Table indicating the probability of a specific child genotype as a function of the corresponding paternal genotypes and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy state.
# MAT: Maternal genotype
# PAT: Paternal genotype
# TYPE: Aneuploid status (d, diploid; m1, maternal MI aneuploidy; m2, maternal MII aneuploidy; p1, paternal MI anueploidy; p2, paternal MII aneuploidy)
# AA - BBB: probability of given genotype 
#
# The probabilities calculated in this table were obtained as outlined in:
# Rabinowitz M, Gemelos G, Banjevic M, Ryan A, Demko Z, Hill M, et al.
# Methods for non-invasive prenatal ploidy calling.
# US Patent Application 14/179,399, 2014. p. 32 [0343]
